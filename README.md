# MP2_LBYARCH

***Acceleration***
Task
Implement a program that computes for the acceleration of multiple cars stored in a Y by 3 matrix. Where Y is the number of cars. All inputs are in single floating point.
The output acceleration for each will be converted into Integers.
Each row will indicate Initial Velocity (in KM/H), Final Velocity (in KM/H), and Time (in Seconds).

Input: Matrix Rows, single float matrix values
Example.
3
0.0, 62.5, 10.1
60.0, 122.3, 5.5
30.0, 160.7, 7.8

Output
Example.
